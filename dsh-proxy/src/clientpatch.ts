/**
 * Loopback-trust alignment for the proxied DSH frontend: exact-string patches
 * applied to JavaScript responses so the browser treats LAN access through
 * this authenticated proxy as host-trusted.
 *
 * Since dsh 0.1.1 the client gates host-bound settings on
 * `connection.isLoopback`, computed from `location.hostname` in the browser
 * (`dsh-client-connection`): a page served from a LAN IP is "remote", the
 * settings mirror stays process-local ("memory") with a permanent
 * "unavailable" snapshot, and surfaces like the settings Models page fail
 * with "settings are unavailable in this browser". The hostname cannot be
 * spoofed from injected HTML, so the proxy rewrites the served bundle bytes
 * instead — the same class of fix as the randomUUID polyfill, but for
 * JavaScript bodies.
 *
 * Through this proxy the trust claim is honest: every request already passed
 * the Basic Auth gate and rides Host/Origin aligned to the upstream loopback
 * authority, which satisfies the server-side `/api` fence exactly like local
 * access does.
